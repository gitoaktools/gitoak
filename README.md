# Gitoak
**Gitoak** is a free file tree extension for GitHub, available on Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

## Introduction
**Gitoak** was developed with the vision of enhancing GitHub repository navigation by seamlessly integrating AI capabilities with the traditional file tree experience. Inspired by popular extensions like Octotree, Gitako, and Span-tree, GitOak takes the file navigation experience to the next level by incorporating AI-powered features.

The main motivation behind **Gitoak** is to bridge the gap between conventional GitHub repository browsing and modern AI assistance. While existing solutions like Octotree provide excellent file tree navigation, GitOak aims to enhance this experience by leveraging AI to help developers better understand, navigate, and interact with code repositories.

1. This is an open-source project, so you can check all the source code.
2. OAuth tokens or personal access tokens are only stored in Chrome's localStorage, as GitHub requires token authentication for API access.
3. All AI settings are stored in Chrome's localStorage as well.
